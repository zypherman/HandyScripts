# HandyScripts
Repo of Handy scripts I have made to do various things

Change commit author email
I found that I had never set my local git config to include user.email so all my commits were not under my git hub account
Git offers a script to fix this for any given repo. I tweaked it a bit to make it a little easier to use as well as take in args for your repo name and email so you dont have to edit the file by hand
